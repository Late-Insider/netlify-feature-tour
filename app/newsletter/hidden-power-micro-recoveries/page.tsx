            How 60-second breaks can transform your productivity and mental health
          </p>
        </header>

        <div className="prose prose-invert prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p>
            We obsess over productivity techniques, time management systems, and optimization strategies. But we often
            overlook the simplest performance enhancer: strategic rest. Not long vacations or weekend breaks—60-second
            micro-recoveries scattered throughout your day.
          </p>

          <h2>The Science of Mental Fatigue</h2>
          <p>
            Your brain isn't designed for sustained focus. Neuroscience shows that mental fatigue accumulates quickly,
            degrading decision-making, creativity, and emotional regulation. After about 90 minutes of focused work,
            your cognitive performance drops significantly.
          </p>

          <p>
            But here's what's fascinating: brief moments of genuine rest can reset this decline. We're not talking about
            switching from email to Slack. We're talking about actual disengagement from all tasks.
          </p>

          <h2>What Counts as a Micro-Recovery</h2>
          <p>Effective micro-recoveries share three characteristics:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Complete task disengagement:</strong> No screens, no work-related thinking
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Physical component:</strong> Stand, stretch, walk, or change position
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Defined duration:</strong> 30-90 seconds is optimal
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>The Micro-Recovery Protocol</h2>
          <p>Here's a simple system that works:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Set a timer for every 25-30 minutes of focused work</li>
            <li>When it rings, stand up immediately</li>
            <li>Close your eyes and take three deep breaths</li>
            <li>Stretch your arms overhead and roll your shoulders</li>
            <li>Look at something distant (out a window if possible)</li>
            <li>Return to work refreshed</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Total time: 60 seconds. Impact: measurable improvement in next work session.</p>

          <h2>Why This Works When Coffee Doesn't</h2>
          <p>
            Caffeine masks fatigue; it doesn't resolve it. Micro-recoveries actually clear accumulated mental
            metabolites and restore cognitive resources. You're not borrowing from future energy—you're genuinely
            replenishing current capacity.
          </p>

          <h2>The Compound Effect</h2>
          <p>
            Four micro-recoveries in a four-hour work session equals four minutes total. That's a 1.7% time investment
            that can improve the other 98.3% of your time significantly.
          </p>

          <p>
            The math is absurd in your favor. The only cost is remembering to do it and overcoming the feeling that you
            can't afford to stop. Spoiler: you can't afford not to.
          </p>

          <h2>Implementation Reality</h2>
          <p>
            You'll forget at first. You'll feel resistance. You'll skip breaks when you're "in flow." Do them anyway.
            Flow states are real, but so is the crash that follows unbroken focus.
          </p>

          <p>
            Set phone reminders. Use apps that block your screen periodically. Put a sticky note on your monitor. Make
            the practice automatic, and watch your sustainable productivity increase.
          </p>

          <p>
            Rest isn't the opposite of productivity. It's a crucial component of it. Master the micro-recovery, and
            you'll outperform those who pride themselves on working without breaks.
