# Deployment Guide

- Production deploys happen when commits land on the `main` branch. In Vercel: Project → Settings → Git → set **Production Branch** to `main`.
- Preview deploys are created automatically for pull requests and are available on the `*.vercel.app` or `v0` preview domains.
- The production domain is **late.ltd** (Project → Settings → Domains).
